# Coffee-Sales-Transaction-_Excel_
I worked on a coffee sales project using Excel to organize and analyze the data. I created new columns to better understand the information in the dataset, created pivot tables and charts, applied basic formula, and developed a dashboard to visualize the information. This made it easier to track important metrics and support decision-making.
